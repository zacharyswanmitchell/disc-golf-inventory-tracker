# Disc Golf Manager
A disc golfinventory app that allows you to keep track of your bags and discs. When I am playing I can never remember which discs I have in my bag and what their flight numbers are. This app will allow you to keep track of all of that information. I made sure to design a layout that worked with mobile since it will be used mostly when out on the course.
